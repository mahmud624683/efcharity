  <h1 id="mainHead"> Chasing the dream (<a href="storybangla.html"> Bangla version </a> )</h1>
  <h3 class="titles">Who am I ?</h3>
  <p> My pursuit of knowledge and excellence began in a poor and illiterate farming family, in a remote village in Bangladesh,where few educational resources were available. My mother is an illiterate housewife and my father had to stop attendingschool during fourth grade to survive during his childhood.  The journey of my education is different from many otherstudents in Bangladesh.  I helped my parents with farming after school and always received less study time than otherstudents.  After successful completion of my higher secondary school certificate examination, despite all the hurdles, theBangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) – the topmost engineering university in Bangladesh –granted me admission, based on a highly competitive entrance examination.  After working for two years in the softwareindustry following the completion of my bachelor’s degree, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) offered meadmission with full funding.  I am the first person who came to the USA for higher education in our local area, whichhas a population of approximately 500,000.  After completion of my master’s degree, I worked for two and a half yearsin the software industry and started my Ph.D. at UCR in 2016.   My journey from a remote village to a capital city inan underdeveloped country, and then from a rural state to one of the busiest states in a developed country.</p>
  <h3 class="titles">Establishment of the Education Foundation</h3>

  <p>The hardships I faced in my studies to get admission at BUET encouraged me to help rural area students in areas similar to
where I was born and raised. During the university holidays, I taught STEM-related courses and guided rural students on
how to get admission to prominent universities in Bangladesh. I started arranging math olympiads, quiz competitions, and
speech competitions with the help of a local club during 2007-2009. Due to the inactivity of the local club, I co-founded the
Education Foundation (http://efcharity.org) in 2010 with some of my friends. We started with fifteen rural area schools and
seven volunteers on the team. Currently, we have more than forty volunteers working on the team. We cover approximately
20,000 students from 71 schools through our ten different programs. </p>
  
  <h3 class="titles">Who are involved and the source of the donation?</h3>
<p>The Education Foundation is entering the 10th year in 2020. Currently, about 40 volunteers are working. Most of the members are public university students. Before 2016, we had donations only from some key members. Now,  we have a good number of friends and wellwishers of the foundation who are supporting various ways to expand our activities. Without their continuous support, our foundation would not come where it stands now. Our activities would not have been possible without the psychological support of the schools' teachers.  We are following the Africa proverb "if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together".  We have the dream to go far. </p>
  <h3 class="titles">Our goals and objectives</h3>
  <p> We are promoting students from rural and underprivileged areas through the foundation. We arrange yearly merit test exams, provide scholarships to bright but needy students for educational purposes, organize educational seminars, and conduct humanitarian works. We plan to create some good people who will continue to do the same things for the next generation. The Education Foundation is a platform where all good students can develop their leadership skills from our area. We formed the executive committee with the current university students. I believe that the actual development of our country will be possible only if the good people of Bangladesh will be in a higher position socially, professionally, and financially.  Together we can develop a better community. </p>

  <p>If you would like to know more about our foundation, please email me or give me your number to my team so that I can speak by phone.</p>
