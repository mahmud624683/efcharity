  <h3 class="titles">Who am I ?</h3>
  <p> My name is Md. Lutfor Rahman. I am a co-founder, director, and an active volunteer at the Education Foundation. I studied at Zionagar Government Primary School from grade one to grade 5. In the fifth grade, I got a scholarship in a general poll from this school. I also got a general poll scholarship in the eighth grade from Mortazapur High School and passed the SSC in 2002. After passing the HSC from Bogra Cantonment Public School and College in 2004, I  got the admission from after a competitive entrance exam. I joined the computer science and engineering department of BUET. I am first who got admission to my area. I graduated from BUET in 2009 and worked as a software engineer in a private company in Bangladesh. In 2012, I started my Masters in Computer Science with a scholarship at the University of Alabama at Birmingham University. After graduating with a Masters in 2014, I worked for two and a half years as a software engineer in two American companies. I started a Ph.D. with a Fellowship at the University of California Riverside in 2016. I am doing research on Brain-Computer Interfaces and the Computer Security field.  One of my studies got huge media attractions, which were published about 500+ online magazines in over twenty languages. My research got accepted in top tier research conferences. I went to Malta and Ireland to present my research. I worked as visiting Researcher at the US Army Research Lab in 2018 and 2019 summer. Currently, I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student. Besides, I am a Co-Founder, Director, and Active Volunteer of the Education Foundation. A large part of my time was spent working with the Education Foundation and currently living in Riverside, California State. From 8000 miles away, I've been trying to do something for the country.</p>
  
  <h3 class="titles">Establishment of the Education Foundation</h3>
 <p>From our zianagor union, I was the first to enter BUET. At Bogra Cantonment Public School and College,  I did reasonably well in the exams. I was on the merit list every week in admission coaching for BUET at Dhaka. Still, I did not believe I would get admission at BUET. The main reason for this was the lack of confidence - no one from my area got admission to a place like BUET, Medical, or Dhaka University, even though we had many excellent students. After getting the admission at BUET, I wanted to do something for our rural area students. During the holidays, I started taking classes on STEM-related courses. I guided students on how to get admission to prominent universities in Bangladesh.  I started arranging math olympiads, quiz competitions, and speech competitions with the help of a local club in 2007-2009. Due to the inactivity of the local club, I co-founded the Education Foundation in 2010 with some of my friends. We are getting a good number of volunteers pool. Over the years, those who got benefitted from Education Foundation are now the active leader in the field level. We termed this phenomenon as the "chain of good works". Enlightenment through education is our goal. The motto of the Education Foundation is "Be a good human, and help to be a good human." Currently, we have 40+ volunteers working at the field level. We cover approximately 20000 students from 71 schools through our several programs. </p>
  <h3 class="titles">Who are involved and the source of the donation?</h3>
<p>The Education Foundation is entering the 10th year in 2020. Currently, about 40 volunteers are working. Most of the members are public university students. Before 2016, we had donations only from some key members. Now,  we have a good number of friends and wellwishers of the foundation who are supporting various ways to expand our activities. Without their continuous support, our foundation would not come where it stands now. Our activities would not have been possible without the psychological support of the schools' teachers.  We are following the Africa proverb "if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together".  We have the dream to go far. </p>
  <h3 class="titles">Our goals and objectives</h3>
  <p> We are promoting students from rural and underprivileged areas through the foundation. We arrange yearly merit test exams, provide scholarships to bright but needy students for educational purposes, organize educational seminars, and conduct humanitarian works. We plan to create some good people who will continue to do the same things for the next generation. The Education Foundation is a platform where all good students can develop their leadership skills from our area. We formed the executive committee with the current university students. I believe that the actual development of our country will be possible only if the good people of Bangladesh will be in a higher position socially, professionally, and financially.  Together we can develop a better community. </p>

  <p>If you would like to know more about our foundation, please email me or give me your number to my team so that I can speak by phone.</p>
